# Week 4 Lab Report
**What we did:** In this lab report, I'll talk about 
three code changes that our group worked on in Lab 3
 and Lab 4 in order to fix a bug in the MarkdownParse.
 java.
 
### First Code Change
**1. Screenshot of the code change**

Here is the screenshot of the code change difference from Github. In this 
file, we basically added a few lines (from line 22 to line 24) which makes
a difference from the origin code.

**2. Link to the test file**

Here is the [test file](https://github.com/CATHCHEN014/markdown-parse/blob/main/test2.md)
for a failure-inducing input that prompted us to make that change above. 
We created a new test2.md which includes two pseudo links (a website link 
and an image link). However, we don't really want the image link in our output.

### Third Code Change

<br/>

these should be stored as commits on someone’s repository. Fork the repository so you have your own copy with all the work your group did if you haven’t already.

For each of the three code changes:

Show a screenshot of the code change diff from Github (a page like this)
Link to the test file for a failure-inducing input that prompted you to make that change
Show the symptom of that failure-inducing input by showing the output of running the file at the command line for the version where it was failing (this should also be in the commit message history)
Write 2-3 sentences describing the relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input.
